# Validating a Form

## Directions

Look at `form.html`. It contains a form for pre-paid parking. It includes some styling already done for you in `style.css`.

You will edit this HTML and write JavaScript to validate this form. When the "Make Reservation" button is clicked, you should check the values of each field and make sure they are valid. If not, you have to visually alert the user to that fact.

Do this project in steps. Each step adds another layer of difficulty. Make sure and commit your code after each step, if not more often. Do not worry if you cannot complete all the steps!

### Handling form submission

When you have validated your form, you should be able to submit the form. Submit the form by sending a POST request to `https://momentum-server.glitch.me/parking`. Your request body needs to include a JSON object with a key `formData`. Normally when we submit a form we want to submit _all_ the data that we've collected, but let's keep this simple so you can focus on the validation. Just include the name your user has entered.

```js
fetch('https://momentum-server.glitch.me/parking', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ formData: { name: nameFromYourForm }})
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(res => {
        // Update the DOM with a message to the user that the form was submitted.
    })
```

But you must prevent the form from being submitted before it's been validated! To do that, use `event.preventDefault()` inside your event listener for the form submission.

When all the fields on the form are valid, you should send the POST request. When you receive a successful response from the server, you should display a message on the page telling the user that the form was submitted successfully. How this message looks is totally up to you.

### Step 0

Read [Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) up through the section titled "A more detailed example" under "Validating forms using JavaScript".

### Step 1

Make each field required. This should only require changes to the HTML. A message should appear on required fields if they are not filled in when the form is submitted.

### Step 2

Add the following validations:

* Car year must be a number. (Consider changing the `type` of the input field.)
* Car year must be after 1900.
* Number of days must be a number.
* Number of days must be between 1 and 30.

### Step 3

Add another validation: CVV must be a three-digit number. This can use the `pattern` attribute, or custom validation with JavaScript.

### Step 4

Add the ability to show the user the total cost of their parking when they click the "Make Reservation" button. The div with id "total" should be filled with text showing the cost. This should only occur if the form is valid.

The cost is $5 per day.

### Step 5

The requirements have changed for calculating cost. The new cost is $5 per weekday, and $7 per weekend day. `.map` and `.reduce` will be very helpful in calculating the total cost, as will [the JavaScript Date object](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-date-in-javascript/).

### Step 6

Validate the format of the credit card number. The following code will let you know if it is valid:

```js
function validateCardNumber(number) {
    var regex = new RegExp("^[0-9]{16}$");
    if (!regex.test(number))
        return false;

    return luhnCheck(number);
}

function luhnCheck(val) {
    var sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < val.length; i++) {
        var intVal = parseInt(val.substr(i, 1));
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            intVal *= 2;
            if (intVal > 9) {
                intVal = 1 + (intVal % 10);
            }
        }
        sum += intVal;
    }
    return (sum % 10) == 0;
}
```

This code only works with 16 digit card numbers. "4111111111111111" is a valid card number you can use for testing purposes.

If the credit card number is invalid, an error message should appear that looks like the rest of the built-in client side validations.

### Step 7

Add the following validations:

* Expiration date must be a valid month and year and in the correct format.
* Expiration date must not be in the past.
* Car year cannot be in the future.
* Date parking must be in the future.

Each of these should also have client-side validation errors.
